# React_Todo_App
This is a simple React App used to manage our daily tasks.
The code is pushed into gh-pages branch.
The server is deployed on render.com so it takes some time to load data from database.
Both the frontend, backend parts were pushed into another repository named mern_stack_CRUD_app.
